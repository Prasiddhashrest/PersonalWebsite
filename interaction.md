# Portfolio Website Interaction Design

## Core Interactive Components

### 1. Interactive Skills Matrix
- **Visual**: Dynamic grid of skills with proficiency levels
- **Interaction**: Hover reveals detailed experience, click filters projects by skill
- **Technologies**: Python, R, Swift, React, JavaScript, C++, Haskell, SQL, Tableau, TensorFlow
- **Animation**: Particles connect related skills, creating visual skill clusters

### 2. Project Timeline Explorer
- **Visual**: Horizontal timeline with project milestones
- **Interaction**: Click timeline points to reveal project details, tech stack, and outcomes
- **Projects**: 
  - Your Forest iOS App (Full Stack Development)
  - GIS Spatial Analysis Platform (R Shiny)
  - Economic Research Dashboard (Kuznets Curve Analysis)
- **Animation**: Smooth transitions between project views with data visualization

### 3. Live Code Demonstration
- **Visual**: Interactive code editor with real-time output
- **Interaction**: Users can modify code snippets and see immediate results
- **Examples**: 
  - Data visualization with Python/matplotlib
  - iOS Swift UI components
  - Statistical analysis with R
- **Animation**: Code typing effect with syntax highlighting

### 4. Research Impact Visualizer
- **Visual**: Interactive charts showing research findings and impacts
- **Interaction**: Users can explore different datasets and analysis methods
- **Data**: Economic indicators, environmental data, user engagement metrics
- **Animation**: Smooth data transitions and hover effects on chart elements

## Multi-turn Interaction Flows

### Skills → Projects Flow
1. User hovers over skill in matrix
2. Related projects highlight in timeline
3. Click skill to filter projects view
4. Deep dive into specific project implementation

### Timeline → Code Flow
1. User selects project from timeline
2. Code examples from that project appear
3. Interactive coding challenges based on project
4. Real-time feedback and results display

### Research → Visualization Flow
1. User explores research methodology
2. Interactive data manipulation tools
3. Custom visualization generation
4. Export/share custom analysis results

## User Experience Goals
- Showcase technical depth through interactive demonstrations
- Provide multiple pathways to explore expertise
- Create memorable, engaging experiences that demonstrate real capabilities
- Enable users to understand complex concepts through interaction
- Build confidence in skills through hands-on examples
